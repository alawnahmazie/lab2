            <p> Hi, my name is Alawnah Dunda and I am a first-generation attending Lesley University in Cambridge, MA. I'm currently a sophmore majoring in UX/UI design and currently a duel athlete participating on the womens volleyball and womens basketball team here. I live in upstate NY, about an hour north of Albany. There I lived on a small owned farm in a very quiet rural environment.</p>
            <h2> Background </h2>
            <p> On December 31, 2005 I was born. The only people in the room at that time were my grandmother and my mother. My father was employed in the army at the time, all the way in Iraq. My mom was–and is–a single mother of two. She only had the help of my grandmother, my aunt and my godmother. They are the ones who made me who I am today. My mom has always inspired me. When she wanted to do something, she could do it. If she couldn’t, she would research and study until she could. She’s a perfectionist, so most things wouldn’t please her but they always amazed me. My mother is an artist at heart,  and that love is something she passed onto me. 
            Since I could remember I’ve been an artist. It made me happy to see my mother smile because I was following in her footsteps. In fourth grade I decided to apply in an art contest in Saratoga. I worked day and night to get the right positioning, the definition and the story behind a simple horse. I ended up landing in first place for my age group. That’s when I absolutely knew art was for me. To have that creative mindset your brain ends up working very differently. It’s as if I am a bird flying with painted wings, constantly flowing with the winds of change. Where others get straight to the point–I’m stewing with my feelings making the smallest things have a bigger purpose. In a similar sense, my mother has always used her creative mind for the greater good, to make others smile. She is always teaching herself how to do things even if most think it’s impossible. “Prove them wrong”, she would always say to me. She has always taught me that I could do anything, I just have to try. 
            While growing up I had tried many new things that I would never do again. Like acting in a play and singing in a talent show. It was something I was never good at, but it was always nice to be a part of a group. So, in the 5th grade when my brother had signed up for basketball, I decided to try out too. The only sport I'd done prior was soccer and I hated it, but I thought I’d give it a try and that was the best decision I've ever made. For the past 8 years I have dedicated my life to that sport. To the point where basketball has become my escape from reality. Although basketball was therapeutic for me, it had involved a lot of hardships; including a fight against favoritism. Like my mother, I was never handed opportunities. I had to show people what I was worth and the dedication I had put in. When other people had put their heads down, I still powered through. Even with both ankles being sprained and broken bones I had to carry on. With my coach, if I had quit at that moment, I would have never seen the court again. During that season I proved to myself that I am strong, passionate and full of perseverance. Just like my mother, I could do anything. 
            My ability to persevere through challenges has helped me get through life altering situations. If I had given up and had not tried something new I would not be in the position I am today. My mother has and continues to show me what being dedicated to something looks like and how it changes one's life. Being able to share my ability to create not only art–but recreate and better myself–is something I will forever be grateful for. While also being able to prove to people that I can do anything as long as I put my mind to it.</p>
